# Introduction

           This project is a machine learning-based assessment of marginal workers in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. The goal of this project is to predict the status of marginal workers in different regions of Tamil Nadu using historical data and machine learning models. This README file provides instructions on how to run the code and reproduce the results.

# Prerequisites

    Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

    - Python (>=3.6)
    - Jupyter Notebook (recommended for running the code interactively)
    - Required Python libraries 
# You can install the required libraries using `pip` by running:
pip install -r requirements

# Data

        The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to its size and licensing restrictions. You will need to obtain the dataset separately and place it in the `data/` directory. The dataset should have the following structure:


#  Running the Code

# 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


# 2. Navigate to the project directory:

     cd marginal_worker

# 3. Place your dataset in the `data/` directory (as described in the "Data" section).

# 4. Open a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment and run the `main.ipynb` file.            
      This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
# Configurations

       You can modify the project configurations by editing the `config.yaml` file. It contains settings for data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
